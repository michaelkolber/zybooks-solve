# zybook-solver

Solves your zyBooks for you. Only solves "Participation" activities by default; see `solver.py` 
docstring for more info.

Using this is probably considered cheating -- only use it with approval from your institution. 
This is more of a case study in reverse-engineering a publicly accessible API and corresponding 
front-end code than it is a tool for solving your zyBooks.

Run `main.py` with the appropriate credentials file (see `solver.py` docstring).
